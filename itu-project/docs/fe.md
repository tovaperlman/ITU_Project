# Feature Engineering

Having retrieved data of many different types, at different geospatial resolutions, from an array of different sources, it was necessary to develop a robust and comprehensive feature engineering pipeline, which produces clean datasets, ready for model application.

## Data Cleaning

* `Numerical Variables` - Impute missing values as variable median.
* `Categorical Variables` - Fill missing values with 'missing' label; perform one-hot encoding.

## Target Variable

* `Brazil` - A4A
* `Thailand` - H107

## Joining Locations
