Here is where we will put our EDA

Lots of Maps here

Satellite Images on a National Level for both Brazil and Thailand:

1. Average Radiance Band
![Brazil Average Radiance]()

![Thailand Average Radiance]()

2. Cloud Free Band

3. Global Human Modification Band

4. NDVI

Now we can show we buffer it for a specific area:

We will subset to a specific admininstrative area or to a buffer area?

5. Show split map depicting nighttime rate of change

6. Map depicting NDVI change

6. Show graphs for monthly mean radiance of a specific area?

Speedtest data

Cell data

Facebook Data?


What do our predictors look like and how do they compare?

Show the buffer zones for schools 

Put automatic EDA script that Utku worked on- are we sharing screenshots or actual code?
