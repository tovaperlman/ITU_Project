# Introduction

## What is the problem? 
Lots of countries around the world, and specific communities within those countries do not have access to the internet. In order to succeed in our fast paced world, it would be beneficial for them to have it. Thus our project seeks 

## Motivation

Connecting to the internet is extremely important in this day and age. By 2030, Project Giga hopes to have every school in the world to have an internet connection. Internet serves as a crucial background to local economies, economic development and individual's ability to get jobs and communicate with the outside world. 

## Use Case

We are trying to predict multiple objectives. Our first objective is to determine on a scale of 0 to 100, the proportion of internet users in a specific area of a country. We are using schools as the anchor points of these predictions as they are also community hubs. Therefore our predictions seek to determine the level of internet connectivity around a school in order to help Project Giga prioritize which schools to connect.

Intenet Connectivity in this instance is defined as any ability to get online. This means both broadband and mobile internet connection. Additionally, it means that individuals must have devices to be able to connect to the internet.

Our second objective, for ITU, is to aggregate our understanding of internet connectivity on a school level up to a country level. While this is not helpful for some countries where national level internet statistics already exist, it will be helpful in countries where there are currently surveys or statistics in order to establish a baseline metric or understanding of countries that have lower or high internet connectivity.
