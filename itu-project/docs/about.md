Who is ITU?

ITU mission is to facilitate connecting all the world's people and to protect and support everyone's right to communicate. ITU and UNICEF have joined forces in the Giga initiative in a bid to connect every school to the Internet by 2030. Aside from directly benefitting children, schools often act as community hubs and so connecting a school often connects the surrounding community too.
