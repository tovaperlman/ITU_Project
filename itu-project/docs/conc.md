## What's Next?

If we had another few months, we would have trained a model on Thailand and perhaps one on the Phillipines. Then we would have loved to combine them into one model to predict for a fourth country. As mentioned prior, we do not have national level statistics or information in any of these models since they are trained on one country exclusively. If we were able to combine different models, we could better know if there is some variance explained by regional or national levels of information as opposed to granular scale information.
